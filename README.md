# Pokedex

This project responds to a technical test of a few hours duration where two tasks were proposed to be accomplished:

- Task 1

We'd like to have a small frontend which lists all Pokémons which exists. Therefore, we have an Pokémon Api or a node_module pokenode-ts.

In the list we'd like to see the name and the image (can be found inside sprites) of the Pokémon. You can use whatever you want (Table, Cards, or other components)

- Task 2

When clicking on one Pokémon we'd like to see some more information of this Pokémon (doesn't really matter which information, just some)

## Backlog

It would be great in the future to implement (not necessarily in this order):

- Pagination
- A search input
- A filter
- React-query for better state handling
- Improve accessibility
- Responsive design
- Animations
- Depending on the type of pokemon, the card should be of a certain color to help differentiation.
- Refactor
- Add more test

## Usage

```bash
$ npm run shop-online
```
